# 🎬 Movie Explorer – Interactive Movie Card Web App

**Movie Explorer** is a dynamic and user-friendly web application that displays a collection of movie cards in a clean, responsive layout. Each movie is presented with key details such as poster image, title, genre, and a rating option, creating an engaging browsing experience for users. The project focuses on implementing interactive UI behavior using JavaScript while maintaining structured and organized HTML and CSS design.

## 🔎 Core Feature: Filtering System

Users can filter movies based on:

- 🎭 **Genre** – Instantly narrow down the displayed movies by selecting a specific category such as Action, Comedy, Horror, Sci-Fi, or others.
- 🔍 **Movie Name** – A real-time search bar allows users to type a movie title and dynamically filter results as they type.

This filtering functionality enhances usability and demonstrates DOM manipulation, event handling, and array filtering logic in JavaScript.

## ⭐ Interactive Rating System

Another key feature is the interactive rating system built directly into each movie card. Users can provide a rating (for example, via stars or input selection). Once a rating is submitted:

- ✅ The rating is captured dynamically.
- 💬 A confirmation message such as **“Rating Submitted Successfully!”** appears inside the same movie card.
- 🔄 The UI updates instantly without refreshing the page.

This feature highlights concepts such as:

- Event listeners  
- Dynamic content updates  
- Conditional rendering  
- User feedback handling  

## 📱 Responsive Design

The layout is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a smooth experience across devices. The project emphasizes clean UI structure, reusable components, and organized code for scalability and maintainability.

## 🚀 Key Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Structure and semantic layout  
- **CSS3** – Styling, responsiveness, and card design  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – DOM manipulation, filtering logic, and rating interaction

This project is ideal for beginners to intermediate developers looking to strengthen their understanding of DOM events, filtering algorithms, and interactive UI components. It can be further enhanced with backend integration, local storage support, animations, or API-based movie data in future updates.
